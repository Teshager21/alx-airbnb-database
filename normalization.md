## 📐 Database Normalization Analysis

This database schema adheres to the principles of **Third Normal Form (3NF)**, ensuring data integrity, reducing redundancy, and supporting scalability.

---

### ✅ First Normal Form (1NF)

- Each table has a **primary key**.
- All columns contain **atomic values** (no repeating groups or arrays).
- Each field holds data of a **single type** per row.

> ✔️ All tables satisfy 1NF.

---

### ✅ Second Normal Form (2NF)

- All tables use a **single-column primary key** (UUIDs).
- No partial dependencies exist — **every non-key column** depends on the whole primary key.

> ✔️ All tables satisfy 2NF.

---

### ✅ Third Normal Form (3NF)

- No **transitive dependencies** are present:
  - In every table, non-key attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key.
  - Example:  
    - In the `users` table, `email`, `role`, and `password_hash` depend only on `user_id`.  
    - In `bookings`, `total_price` is stored as a final amount and not derived dynamically from related tables, so it does not violate 3NF.
- No derived or redundant data is stored across tables.

> ✔️ All tables satisfy 3NF.

### 🧠 Conclusion

The schema is:
- 📦 **Efficiently structured**
- 🔁 **Free of update anomalies**
- 🧼 **Cleanly normalized**

This makes the database easy to query, maintain, and scale. Optional improvements (like splitting locations or enums into lookup tables) can be added based on future requirements, but are not needed for 3NF compliance.
